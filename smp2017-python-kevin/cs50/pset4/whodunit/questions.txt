1.  stdint.h is a header file that changes the type of integers depending on no: of bytes needed to use, etc using macros
2.  Based on how the integer type has to be used (i.e no of bytes, signed and unsigned) uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t are used
3.  BYTE:1, DWORD:4, LONG:4, WORD:2
4.  The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character "B" then the character "M"
5.  bf is size of the bmp file while bi is size of the structure
6.  If biHeight is negative,the image is bottom down.
7.  biBitCount
8.  whe the file doesn't exist
9.  reading pixel 1 by 1
10. 3
11. changes pointer's position
12. tells current position
