As copying large structs take time and also uses up memory, therefore passed by address.
4.  TODO
We use fgetc() function to read each character from the text which is checked until EOF is received,
furthur each character is checked whether its alphabetical or an apostrophe, if its not, that word is
consumed and not sent for checking, with each character read, an index increases which is the length
of the word, if it goes beyond 45, it is not considered as a word. Also, when the char is neither a 
digit nor an alphabet it is considered that a word is found.

5.  TODO
fscanf reads a string till a whitespace character, however it doesnt check whether there is any digit
in the string or is it alphabetical, also it will read the string as a word even if it is gibberish
and more than 45 words. Therefore we use fgetc().

6.  TODO
The parameters are constant so that the values arent changed by the program. We do not want to mistakenly somehow change the input text.
